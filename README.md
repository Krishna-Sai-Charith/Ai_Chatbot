# ðŸ§µ Llama3.2 Clothing Store Chatbot

This project is a simple AI chatbot built using Llama3.2 and Gradio. The chatbot acts as a **sales assistant for a clothing store**, handling customer queries in a friendly, helpful way.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

- The chatbot starts as a **general helpful assistant**.
- It then switches to **sales mode**, encouraging customers to buy hats and clothes that are on sale.
- Special product-specific responses are included:
  - Hats are promoted with **60% discounts**.
  - Most other clothing items are promoted with **50% discounts**.
  - Shoes are **not on sale**, but hats are recommended instead.
  - Belts are **not sold**, and the chatbot gently redirects the customer to available sale items.
- The chatbot streams responses in real-time using Ollama and is accessible via a simple Gradio web interface.

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- Multiple conversational flows depending on customer queries.
- Dynamic behavior with evolving system messages.
- Real-time response streaming for a natural chat experience.
- Modular code â€” easy to expand with new sale items or product logic.

## âœ… Why This Exists

The project is designed for:
- Practicing how to **adjust AI assistant behavior** based on context.
- Experimenting with **real-time chat interfaces**.
- Creating a base structure for store-specific or business-specific AI bots.

## ðŸ“… Quick Reminder

Whenever you revisit this project:
- Remember itâ€™s about **a dynamic AI store assistant focused on product promotion**.
